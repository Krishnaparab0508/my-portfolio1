  Programming and web development are my core areas of expertise. I have
  developed proficiency in HTML and CSS, allowing me to create dynamic and
  visually appealing websites. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into
  functional and user-friendly web experiences. Through web development, I aim

  Aside from my technical skills, I have a passion for painting. I am proficient
  in various traditional painting mediums such as oil, acrylic, and watercolor.
  Painting allows me to express my creativity and provides a different outlet
  for my artistic side. It is a hobby that brings me joy and helps me explore
  different forms of self-expression.
